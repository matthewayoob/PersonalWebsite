                    If you were to ask my friends, "What is Matthew Ayoob like?", they would most definitely respond that my art is fundamental to my personality. I was a violinist in the West Virginia Youth Strings and Symphony Orchestra for my entire high school career and was even the sole member of the West Virginia Youth Symphony's Board of Directors. Since 2011, I have studied violin. In 2017, I performed in Hungary, Slovakia, & the Czech Republic with my symphony, a cinematic experience. I was Maestro of West Virginia Youth Strings’ performance of “Slavonic Dance” in 2019 for a venue of 3,000. Since 2018, I have studied at the Academy of Music for vocal performance, having 6 solo recitals (performing one each in Italian and French). As a National Anthem Vocal Soloist, I performed at sporting events and heritage festivals 11 times. Studio art has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. When I attended the WV Governor's School for the Arts, studying technique strengthened my artistic passion. I was the “Crowd Favorite” art piece for the FestivALL teen art show and exhibited in Gallery Eleven/Art Walk and in the Clay Center (2016-2018). I have been cast in a plethora of lead roles in my community and my high school Drama Club. One of my greatest disappointments was the cancellation of "Into the Woods" due to COVID-19, as I was so ready to be "The Baker". My propensity toward many art forms is something I plan to continue in my pursuit of academia, and I plan to design in the future--parlaying my love of computer science and studio art.

            In high school, I was proud to be Valedictorian, a National Merit Scholar, Student Body President, and Varsity Cross Country Captain--earning a 4.7 GPA.  As a novice writer I felt empowered talking about poignant issues, such as my long term project on

                . My articles of social justice & political nature, cover illustrations, and art pieces have been published 25+ in high school. An excerpt of my article was shared on Twitter by a HuffPost Senior Editor in 2019. Accordingly, I am excited to continue writing throughout college and for Stanford University.

                I was honored to be a National Merit Finalist and valedictorian of my high school, finishing with a GPA of 4.66, the highest possible. I was the sole candidate from my high school for the U.S. Presidential Scholars Program and placed at West Virginia Math Field Day in 2020. My academic prowess was also applied to my AP tests, being awarded AP Scholar with Distinction in 2019 and 2020. However, I knew I could not focus my energy merely in the classroom. I was proud to be elected as class representative all my years of high school and for that to culminate in Student Body President my senior year. In Cross Country, I worked my way to be Varsity Captain in both junior and senior year after running since sixth grade. 
                Each summer, being selected for and attending every West Virginia Governor's School led me to design an original product ("Caja Case"), diversify my artistic portfolio, brainstorm energy alternatives, and break down casino games mathematically. When I was not enjoying those enriching camps, I would spend my free time as a volunteer for the Ronald McDonald House Charities. Words cannot describe how my time there shifted my world view, opening mind to life's relativity.
